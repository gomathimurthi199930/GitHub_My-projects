# PowerBI_Project
## Project Objective
This project connects SQL Server with Power BI to visualize historical and forecasted weather data.It focuses on analyzing temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility through dynamic dashboards.The aim is to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies to support weather-related decision-making.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/gomathimurthi199930/GitHub_My-projects/blob/main/WeatherHistory.csv"> view Data set</a>

## Questions:
- What was the highest recorded temperature? (year)
- What was the lowest recorded temperature? (year) 
- What is the average wind speed for each season? 
- What is the average humidity?
- Which month had the highest average temperature?
- Which month had the lowest average temperature? 
- What is the average temperature for each month?
- What is the average temperature over the year?
- What is the temperature variation (Diff between max & min temp) in each month?
- Average temperature prediction for after 10 years?
- What is top 5 lowest visibility based on seasons?
- Is there a correlation between temperature and humidity?

## Process
- Data Preparation: Imported historical weather data (2006â€“2025) into SQL Server and structured it with key attributes like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
- Data Connection: Connected SQL Server to Power BI and loaded the required tables for analysis.
- Data Transformation: Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query and DAX to create calculated fields and KPIs.
- Dashboard Visualization: Built interactive visuals (charts, slicers, KPIs) in Power BI to analyze weatherdata.
